Package `DESCRIPTION` files allows for specifying several types of inter-package
relations. These include fields like Depends, Suggests, Enhances etc. This
package allows for recovering graph structure based on these relations. Network
representation of R repositories enables the user to explore the interconnected
space of available R functionality while the developers or repository
maintainers can quickly scan package forward and reverse dependencies.

The main function `pkgnet` creates an igraph object of packages available in specified repository.

# Examples


## Network based on current snapshot of CRAN

This will fetch data on packages available on CRAN at this very moment and transform it to an igraph object:

```{r current_cran}
g <- pkgnet("cran")
summary(g)
```

Thus we have `r vcount(g)` packages in total. This however includes also packages that are not available on CRAN, but are mentioned by other packages in their `DESCRIPTION` files. This can be checked using the `Repository` field - there will be `NA` for packages not available:

```{r}
sum( is.na(V(g)$Repository) )
```




## Graph of packages related to network analysis

Let extract a subgraph of packages depending on one of the packages providing facilities to store and process network data ("graph", "igraph", "network", "networkDynamic").

Get the neighborhoods and make the graph:

```{r network}
seeds <- c("igraph", "network", "graph")
n <- neighborhood(g, 1, V(g)[ name %in% seeds ], mode="in" )
sg <- simplify( induced.subgraph(g, unique(unlist(n)) ) )
summary(sg)
```

Plot it. Colors show which of the "seed" packages a given package depends on:

```{r network_plot}
set.seed(2992)

# Coordinates
xy <- layout.fruchterman.reingold(sg)

# Colors
d <- distances(sg, to=V(sg)[ name %in% seeds], mode="out")
x <- apply(d, 1, function(x) paste(sort(colnames(d)[x == min(x)]), collapse="-"))
pal <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(length(unique(x)), "Set1")
cols <- pal[ match(x, sort(unique(x)))]

# Plot
plot(sg, 
     vertex.size=ifelse( V(sg)$name %in% seeds, 8, 5),
     vertex.color=cols,
     layout=xy, 
     vertex.label.color="black",
     # vertex.frame.color = par("bg"),
     edge.arrow.size=.5, 
     vertex.label=NA,
     margin=0
     )
legend("topright",
       sort(unique(x)),
       pch=21,
       pt.bg=pal,
       col="black",
       bty="n"
       )
```
