Description: Package DESCRIPTION files allows for specifying several types of
    inter-package relations.  These include fields like Depends, Suggests,
    Enhances etc. This package allows for recovering graph structure based
    on these relations. Network representation of R repositories enables
    the user to fruitfully explore the interconnected space of available R
    functionality while the developers or repository maintainers can
    quickly scan package forward and reverse dependencies.
