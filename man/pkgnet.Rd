\usage{
pkgnet(a, enams = c("Depends", "Suggests", "Imports", "Enhances",
  "LinkingTo"), vnams = c("Version", "Priority", "License", "License_is_FOSS",
  "License_restricts_use", "OS_type", "Archs", "MD5sum", "NeedsCompilation",
  "File", "Repository"))
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{matrix, as returned by \code{available.packages}}

\item{enams}{character, names of columns of \code{a} that are to be used as
edge attributes}

\item{vnams}{character, names of columns of \code{a} that are to be used as
vertex attributes}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{igraph}.
}
\description{
Given the matrix as returned by \code{available.packages} construct a graph,
of class \code{igraph} of inter-package relations.
}
\details{
The resulting graph (object of class \code{igraph}) is a multigraph: there
can be multiple relationships between any given pair of vertices. Different
types of relations can be disentagled using edge attribute called
\code{type}. It stores the type of relation as provided with \code{enams}
argument.

\examples{

# a <- available.packages(contrib.url("http://cran.r-project.org", "source"))
# g <- pkgnet(a)
# summary(g)
